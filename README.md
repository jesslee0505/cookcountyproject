Importance
----

Cook County, Illinois, is one of the largest and most populous counties in the United States. Accurate property assessments in Cook County are crucial due to the significant impact they have on property taxes, which affect homeowners and local government budgets. By improving the accuracy of home price predictions, this project aims to contribute to fairer property tax assessments and better-informed real estate decisions, while recognizing that there may be inherent bias in the data.

Outcome
----

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering**: Conducted EDA and added features such as the number of bedrooms. Applied data preprocessing techniques including one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
1. **Model Performance**: Achieved a training RMSE of less than 70,000 on the final linear regression model, which represents a significant improvement from nearly 400,000 on previous models. This corresponds to a reduction of approximately 80% in RMSE, demonstrating the effectiveness of the enhancements made.
